Git: Perfectly Ruined Objectification

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wackloner/JavaSPbAU.svg?branch=gitpro)](https://travis-ci.org/wackloner/JavaSPbAU)

Implementation of reduced version of well-known VCS git.

I would advice to use it never.
 
Has a lot of bugs and will probably delete all files on your computer.
 
I don't know what else to say.

Have a nice day.
