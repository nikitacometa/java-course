Tricky left Massive Attack to release his debut album Maxinquaye.
The album was successful and Tricky consequently attained international fame,
something he was notably uncomfortable with.
The Maxinquaye album review by Rolling Stone magazine read:
"Tricky devoured everything from American hip-hop and soul to reggae
and the more melancholic strains of '80s British rock".
