Portishead's first album Dummy was released in 1994.
The cover features a still from the band's own short film To Kill a Dead Man.
The credits indicate that at this juncture,
Portishead was a duo of Geoff Barrow and Beth Gibbons.
Adrian Utley, who co-produced the album with them
(and who played on nine of the tracks and co-wrote eight),
became an official band member shortly after its release.
